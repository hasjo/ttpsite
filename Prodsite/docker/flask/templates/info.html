		The Thought Police is built upon three central ideals
              </p>
	      <h2>1. Not Mythic Raiding</h2>
	      <p class="lead">
		Coming from a backround of previously raiding mythics, we've decided that it's time to slow down and just have fun doing the content. We will still do heroic raids and we won't just take it super casually through them either (see point 2).
              </p>
	      <h2>2. Success on Raid Night</h2>
	      <p class="lead">
		On raid night, people will be flasked, enchanted, gemmed and prepared to raid. We expect people to be able to play their class at a level that is conducive to success. We aren't afraid of taking in newer raiders if they are willing to put the time in to learn their class and come to raid prepared to succeed. Due to the overall laid back nature of the guild though, we won't just drop you if you aren't doing as well as you could. We will work with you to help achieve the level of skill we like to see in a raider.
              </p>
	      <h2>3. Having Fun</h2>
	      <p class="lead">
		At the end of the day, WoW is still a game you are paying to get enjoyment out of. We feel that you should be enjoying the game first and foremost and we aim to avoid many of the pitfalls of other more hardcore guilds. Usually the only time we get super serious when it comes to raiding is when it comes to the more difficult progression bosses. Other than that we like to keep it chill and lighthearted.
